```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

when we do git init, should we always do that from a seperate directory? I think so.
if you've already done git init you don't need to do it again
each git repo should be a seperate project







Exercise: As a next step in the analysis of the gapminder_unfiltered data frame, add code in life_exp_analysis.Rmd that

    Loads the gapminder_unfiltered data frame into R, and
    Calculates the maximum life expectancy each year and the corresponding country that had that maximum life expectancy. Hint: There are multiple ways to do this, but the easiest involves group_by() and filter().

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
gapminder_unfiltered %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(lifeExp==max(lifeExp)) %>%
  select(country,year,lifeExp) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(year)
```
